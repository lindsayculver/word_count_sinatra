so the easiest spec to start with would be having your program
call back one word at a time.

 behavior: returns a word
 input: "lindsay"
 output: lindsay



but we want it to return a number.

 behavior: returns a number
 input: "lindsay", 'lindsay'
 output: 1



then you want it to be able to handle a string. so you have to
split up a phrase and count how many times the word being searched
pops up.

 behavior: runs the program, splits into words, returns a number
 input: "wow wow wow lindsay", 'wow' is search word
 output: 3



the next thing i think would make it better is to downcase the input
so the program works even If SOmEbody TYPES liKE THiS.

 behavior: returns all kinds of input (that are letters) as a number
 input: "WOW wow WoW lIndSaY", 'wow' is search word
 output: 3



and for both fields.

  behavior: returns all kinds of input (that are letters) in search
  word field as a number
  input: "wow wow wow lindsay", 'WOW' is search word
  output: 3
